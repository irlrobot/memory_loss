Memory Loss is a party game that will hurt your head!  Playing is easy.  Alexa will give you a series of words, numbers, or letters and your job is to remember them.  Then she'll ask a question and all you have to do is reply yes or no.  This deceptively simple game is best played with a group of friends or family; the more the better!  For the most fun, try making up your own scoring system or dishing out punishments for incorrect answers.  New questions are added weekly.

Example rules you can implement to make the game more fun:
* Playing with family?  The winner is relieved of any chore duty for the weekend!
* Playing with a group of friends on a Friday night?  Take a drink if you answer incorrectly!
* Need to determine who goes first?  Whoever has the longest tongue!
